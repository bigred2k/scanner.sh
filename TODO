TODO:

Definitely:
- add conditional to the cd function in the CMS updates process so that it 'echo's the current docroot to the console:

 if cd docroot; then pwd; else echo "Failed to cd into $docroot, does this directory exist"; fi for custom handling

- support for drupal multisite which I believe is lacking

Maybe:
- make it easier to create new clamav signatures from malware samples which are currently undetected by maldet/clamav

- support for showing the top x IPs to hit the server over the last x days

- enumeration of PHP scripts that have been 'POST'ed to

Probably not:
- 'ssdeep -drp /directory to scan/' function?
