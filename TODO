- add conditional to the cd function in the CMS updates process so that it 'echo's the current docroot to the console:

- Add the following blurbs (rewrite if needed) to the CMS updates section:

Please also let us know if you need any assistance with malicious file removal or CMS updates.

The page at https://www.drupal.org/security is another highly recommended resource. In addition to the news page and sub-tabs, all security announcements are posted to an email list. To subscribe to email: log in, go to your user profile page and subscribe to the security newsletter on the Edit Â» My newsletters tab.
You can also get rss feeds for core, contrib, or public service announcements or follow @drupalsecurity on Twitter.


Maybe:
- make it easier to create new clamav signatures from malware samples which are currently undetected by maldet/clamav

- support for showing the top x IPs to hit the server over the last x days

- enumeration of PHP scripts that have been 'POST'ed to

Probably not:
- 'ssdeep -drp /directory to scan/' function?
