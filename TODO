TODO:


Definitely:

- breakup last find into 2 separates, 1 for directories (with a note in the output about this being a possible indicator a recrusive permissions reset on the docroot could be required) and 1 for files (heavily grep'd out)

cleanup output for last find:

grep -vi 'png$\|jpg$\|jpeg$\|pdf$\|gif$\|gz.info$\|doc$\|docx$\|cache\|twig' 
find / -user apache -group apache 2>/dev/null | grep -vi 'png$\|jpg$\|jpeg$\|pdf$\|gif$\|gz.info$\|doc$\|docx$\|cache\|twig\|gluster\|proc'


- add conditional to the cd function in the CMS updates process so that it 'echo's the current docroot to the console:

 if cd docroot; then pwd; else echo "Failed to cd into $docroot, does this directory exist"; fi for custom handling

- add exclusions for the following locations when 'cat'ing maldet results into scan_results.txt

/usr/share/clamav/rfxn.hdb
/usr/share/clamav/rfxn.yara
/usr/share/clamav/rfxn.ndb
/var/lib/clamav/rfxn.hdb
/var/lib/clamav/rfxn.ndb
/usr/local/src/maldetect_bm/files/sigs/hex.dat
/usr/local/src/maldetect_bm/files/sigs/rfxn.hdb
/usr/local/src/maldetect_bm/files/sigs/rfxn.ndb

- support for drupal multisite which I believe is lacking

- support for showing the top x IPs to hit the server over the last x days

- enumeration of PHP scripts that have been 'POST'ed to


Maybes:
- make it easier to create new clamav signatures from malware samples which are currently undetected by maldet/clamav


Probably nots:
- 'ssdeep -drp /directory to scan/' function?
